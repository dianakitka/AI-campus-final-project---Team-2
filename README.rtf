 # AI Campus Final Project \
	Cancer Subtype Multi-classification in Gene Expression Data \

This project was developed as part of the Cedars-Sinai AI Campus course, where we worked on unsupervised and supervised learning methods e.g., a machine learning model for cancer subtype classification using TCGA data.\
1. Unsupervised learning methods, clustering to explore the data\
2. Supervised learning methods and fine parameter tuning for the best model performance. \
\
## Summary\
\
- **Goal**: [e.g., Build and evaluate a classification model to predict cancer subtypes]\
- **Data**: [e.g., TCGA RNA-seq gene expression data]\
- **Model(s) used**: [e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost]\
- **Feature selection**: [e.g., Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), permutation importance]\
- **Results**: [e.g., Achieved X% accuracy of logistic regression model; feature importance per cancer class; clustering and dimensional reduction with important features per class]\

## Notes\

This project was completed as a collaborative effort during the Cedars-Sinai AI Campus program by Team 2. I\'92d be excited to continue contributing next year as an assistant coach.\
